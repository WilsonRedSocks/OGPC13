The apocalypse occurred one hundred years ago, and humanity went into a time of darkness. Now, the human race has recovered, but there is no biodiversity. You are part of an elite force that is tasked with going to the abandoned cities of the past, and finding missing seeds in order to rebuild biodiversity. This task is crucial in order to restore the diversity of the plant life on Earth. Good luck!
